This repository displays the codes for our paper "Utility Maximization for Wireless Content Caching Networks with Diversified Recommendation"
The code convergence.m generates Fig. 1. The parameter x in Line 11 can be tuned to get different convergence curves.
The code main_utilityVSbarC.m generates Figs. 2a, 3a and 6. The content size distribution can be changed by adjusting Line 30.
The code main_utilityVSR.m generates Figs. 2b and 3b. The content size distribution can be changed by adjusting Line 29. The inversely proportional acceptance rate can be activated by uncommenting Line 27.
The code main_diverstyVSR.m generates Fig. 4. The inversely proportional acceptance rate can be activated by uncommenting Line 27.
The code main_CHRVSR.m generates Fig. 5. The inversely proportional acceptance rate can be activated by uncommenting Line 27.
